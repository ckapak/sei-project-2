<h1>UK Crime Checker</h1>
​
<h2>Software Engineering Immersive – Project 02</h2>
​
This was my second project (built in a group) on the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly in week 6.
​
<h2>The application was built with:</h2>
<ol>
<li>React</li>
<li>Metropolitan Police API - https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-categories/</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Bulma</i>
<li>Mapbox</li>
</ol>
​
<h2>Deployment</h2>
This application was deployed on Heroku at https://ga-sei-project.herokuapp.com/
​
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Use the clone button to download the website source code. From the root directory type 'npm run server' in the terminal. The project will run on localhost:8000.
​
<h2>Website Architecture</h2>
The app consists of a search facility that filters through crime categories (i.e. anti-social behaviour, drugs) available on the API and the results are displayed on a map.

​
<h2>1. Home/Index Page</h2>
​
<p>a. The first section of the app has a select/dropdown menu that lists specific crime categories available on the API – the user can select a category and type in a postcode, click the “Filter Crime” button and see a number of found crimes and their placement of the map with red dots as the markers.</p>
<p>b. The second section consists of a map and demonstrates Mapbox's “Marker”, “Popup” and “Geocoder” features. </p>
​
<h2>The API</h2>
​
The API is updated once every month - it is a complex API with a lot of data, so we had to limit our search to one search filter at a time.  The call limit operates with a 'leaky bucket' algorithm as a controller which allows for infrequent bursts of calls, and allows you to continue to make an unlimited amount of calls over time.
​
Due to this and our machines not being able to handle too much data (at least not in a user friendly way, having a prolonged waiting time), the shown data was limited to a maximum of 300 results. If the number of results exceeded this maximum number, we could risk having the server crashing with a HTTP 429 error. 
​
<p>Below is an excerpt of code from the Home Page which was built as a classical React component.</p>

​
<h2>Mapbox</h2>
​
After carefully reading the documentation, Mapbox was incredibly easy to implement - it was up and running in no time at all. What has proved to be a more tedious process was turning the coordinates of a certain crime (provided by the API as a string) into actual markers on the map. 
​
<p>The process of rendering the data on the map was made possible by utilising a classical React component using a map function that maps through different categories of crimes provided by the API. The Pop Ups have been placed using the same coordinates. </p>
​
<p>We styled the application with Bulma.</p>

​
<h2>Challenges and future improvements</h2>
One of the main challenges was placing the provided coordinates on the map. We had to create a second axios GET request and map through the crimes and associated coordinates. This was new process for us and it took a while to work through.<br>

​
<p>As an improvement, refactoring the code would help speed up the process of loading the page which - at the moment - is rather slow. The possibility to search through the crimes based on the date and more information on the crime would definitely be a great step forward. </p>
